analysis - MSM analysis functions (:mod:`msmtools.analysis`)
==============================================================

.. currentmodule:: msmtools.analysis

This module contains functions to analyze a created Markov model, which is
specified with a transition matrix T.

Validation
==========

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   is_transition_matrix - Positive entries and rows sum to one
   is_tmatrix
   is_rate_matrix - Nonpositive off-diagonal entries and rows sum to zero
   is_connected - Irreducible matrix
   is_reversible - Symmetric with respect to some probability vector pi

Decomposition
=============

Decomposition routines use the scipy LAPACK bindings for dense
numpy-arrays and the ARPACK bindings for scipy sparse matrices.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   stationary_distribution - Invariant vector from eigendecomposition
   statdist
   eigenvalues - Spectrum via eigenvalue decomposition
   eigenvectors - Right or left eigenvectors

   timescales - Implied timescales from eigenvalues

Expected counts
=================

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   expected_counts - Count matrix expected for given initial distribution
   expected_counts_stationary - Count matrix expected for equilibrium distribution

Passage times
