def flux_matrix(T, pi, qminus, qplus, netflux=True):
    r"""Compute the TPT flux network for the reaction A-->B.

    Parameters
    ----------
    T : (M, M) ndarray
        transition matrix
    pi : (M,) ndarray
        Stationary distribution corresponding to T
    qminus : (M,) ndarray
        Backward comittor
    qplus : (M,) ndarray
        Forward committor
    netflux : boolean
        True: net flux matrix will be computed
        False: gross flux matrix will be computed

    Returns
    -------
    flux : (M, M) ndarray
        Matrix of flux values between pairs of states.

    Notes
    -----
    Computation of the flux network relies on transition path theory
    (TPT). The central object used in transition path theory is the
    forward and backward comittor function.
